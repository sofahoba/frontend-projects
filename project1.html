            Today marked my first offline session with Marwa Eleithy, and it was incredibly enlightening. Marwa's expertise and approachable teaching style made the session enjoyable and highly informative. We began with an introduction to CSS, where she explained its role in styling and laying out web pages. She covered the basics, including selectors, properties, values, and the differences between external, internal, and inline styles. Her explanations were clear, and practical examples solidified my understanding. The second part of our session focused on creating forms in HTML. Marwa explained the importance of forms in web development and guided me through building a simple form, covering key concepts like form elements, labels, accessibility, and form attributes. With her guidance, I created a functional and aesthetically pleasing form. Overall, my first session with Marwa was a success, and I look forward to continuing my journey in web development with her guidance.
